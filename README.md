## Bookit

If you visit `http://localhost:port/book` you should find [Bookit](https://github.com/leveluptuts/bookit/), which is extremly helpful when designing new components.

A folder named `bookit` will be created in the `src` directory, with an example component inside it. You may use this folder when prototyping new components.

Done! go build your idea
